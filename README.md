### 📌 Project Overview
As a Data Analyst, I analyzed **1,000+ real-time job postings** to identify salary trends, location hotspots, and technical skill demands in the US and India.

### 🔍 Key Insights
* **Python Dominance:** Python is required in **70%** of data roles, significantly outpacing R.
* **Salary Trends:** Hybrid roles in major tech hubs (Bengaluru/US West Coast) offer **20% higher compensation** than fully remote roles.
* **Skill Clusters:** High correlation between "SQL" and "Power BI" in entry-level job descriptions.

### 🛠️ Technical Workflow
1.  **Data Cleaning (Power Query):** Parsed "Skills" columns from raw text into countable categories.
2.  **Data Modeling:** Established a Star Schema connecting Job Facts to Location and Company Dimensions.
3.  **Visualization (Power BI):** Created interactive maps and dynamic slicers.
